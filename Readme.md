### Collection of snippets, extensions and components to use in Unity.


This is a loosely organized collections of various code bits I created when coding for Unity and consider useful enough to organize them in their own repository. When starting a new Unity-project I usually include this repository as a submodule and create a new branch to adapt the suite to my needs. Useful changes and additions are then later transferred to the master branch.
